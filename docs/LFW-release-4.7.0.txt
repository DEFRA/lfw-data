# Instructions for webops

Note: This release involves a deployment of the LFW node applications, and also a deployment of the lfw-data serverless application.
It also involves the addition of the service refresh environment link https://check-for-flooding.prd.defra.cloud/ therefore the presence of this environment is a prerequisite. At the time of writing (22.1.21) it is avaiable with correct ssl certification.

## LFW-DATA (v2.1.0) - https://github.com/DEFRA/lfw-data/releases/tag/2.1.0

Execute job: LFW_{stage}_99_DEPLOY_LFW_DATA (in misc dir)

-- please ensure successful deployment before moving on


## LFW (v4.7.0) - https://gitlab-dev.aws-int.defra.cloud/flood/lfw/-/tree/production

Execute job: LFW_{stage}_03_UPDATE_FLOOD_APP_SERVICE

Please beware there is a new config value for the application `betaUrl`, there is risk the build will fail if the value is not in the config file, but I have checked master branch for presence.

-- On completion inform flood dev and test to perform checks

Thanks.
