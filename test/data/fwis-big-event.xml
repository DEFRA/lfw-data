Following the overnight rain, water levels in the river are now rising again and will continue to do so for at least the next 12 hours. Water levels will be high around Wellow Mill in the very early hours of Tuesday morning. Later on tonight and into tomorrow another band of heavy rain is forecast as stormy weather continues to impact West Hampshire.  By Tuesday morning water levels in the river could be as high as those that were observed on Sunday lunchtime.  River levels are unlikely to return to normal until Wednesday when more settled weather conditions return. Until then, Wellow Mill and low lying land from Landford to Wade Bridge will remain vulnerable to flooding.
